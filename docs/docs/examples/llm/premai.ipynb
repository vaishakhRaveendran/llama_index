    "2. Go to [app.premai.io](https://app.premai.io) and this will take you to the project's dashboard. \n",

    "\n",
    "4. Head over to LaunchPad (the one with ðŸš€ icon). And there deploy your model of choice. Your default model will be `gpt-4`. You can also set and fix different generation paramters (like: max-tokens, temperature etc) and also pre-set your system prompt. \n",
