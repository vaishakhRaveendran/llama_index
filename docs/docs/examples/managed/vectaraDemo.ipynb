    "Vectara provides an end-to-end managed service for Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG, which includes:\n",
    "1. A way to extract text from document files and chunk them into sentences.\n",
    "2. The state-of-the-art [Boomerang](https://vectara.com/how-boomerang-takes-retrieval-augmented-generation-to-the-next-level-via-grounded-generation/) embeddings model. Each text chunk is encoded into a vector embedding using Boomerang, and stored in the Vectara internal vector store. Thus, when using Vectara with LlamaIndex you do not need to call a separate embedding model - this happens automatically within the Vectara backend.\n",
    "3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embedding, and retrieves the most relevant text segments (including support for [Hybrid Search](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/lexical-matching) and [MMR](https://vectara.com/get-diverse-results-and-comprehensive-summaries-with-vectaras-mmr-reranker/))\n",

      "Response: The risks of AI involve potential biases, opaque decision-making processes, and lack of public trust due to discriminatory outcomes and biased data [1]. To mitigate these risks, industry is implementing innovative solutions like risk assessments and monitoring mechanisms [2]. Stakeholder engagement and the development of a risk management framework by organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology aim to manage risks posed by AI to individuals, organizations, and society [3]. Identification and mitigation of potential risks, impact assessments, and balancing high impact risks with appropriate mitigation are crucial before and during the deployment of AI systems [5].

Firstly, it is crucial to ensure that automated systems are designed with safety and effectiveness in mind, following principles such as being lawful, purposeful, accurate, secure, and transparent [2]. Entities should proactively identify and manage risks associated with sensitive data, conducting regular audits and limiting access to prevent misuse [3], [4], [5]. Additionally, ongoing monitoring of automated systems is essential to detect and address algorithmic discrimination and unforeseen interactions that could lead to misuse [6], [7]. By incorporating these practices into the design, development, and deployment of AI technologies, the potential for misuse by malicious entities can be significantly reduced.\n",

Organizations are incorporating protections and ethical principles in AI development, aligning with global recommendations for responsible AI stewardship [2]. Furthermore, research is ongoing to enhance explainable AI systems for better human understanding and trust in AI outcomes [5]. The U.S. government is establishing councils and frameworks to advance AI technologies, ensuring responsible AI implementation across sectors [4], . AI can streamline processes, improve decision-making, and enhance efficiency, although challenges like bias, flaws, and accessibility issues need to be addressed to maximize its benefits [5].\n",
