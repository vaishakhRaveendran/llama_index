Deleting entities by primary key is much faster and lighter than deleting them by complex boolean expressions. This is because Milvus executes queries first when deleting data by complex boolean expressions.  \\nDeleted entities can still be retrieved immediately after the deletion if the consistency level is set lower than Strong.\\nEntities deleted beyond the pre-specified span of time for Time Travel cannot be retrieved again.\\nFrequent deletion operations will impact the system performance.  \\nBefore deleting entities by comlpex boolean expressions, make sure the collection has been loaded.\\nDeleting entities by complex boolean expressions is not an atomic operation. Therefore, if it fails halfway through, some data may still be deleted.\\nDeleting entities by complex boolean expressions is supported only when the consistency is set to Bounded. For details, see Consistency.\\\\\\n\\\\\\n# Delete Entities\\n## Prepare boolean expression\\nPrepare the boolean expression that filters the entities to delete.  \\nMilvus supports deleting entities by primary key or complex boolean expressions.

In the context of a Milvus vector database, an upsert is a data-level operation that will overwrite an existing entity if a specified field already exists in a collection, and insert a new entity if the specified value doesn’t already exist.  \\nThe following example upserts 3,000 rows of randomly generated data as the example data. When performing upsert operations, it\\'s important to note that the operation may compromise performance. This is because the operation involves deleting data during execution.\\\\\\n\\\\\\n# Upsert Entities\\n## Prepare data\\nFirst, prepare the data to upsert. The type of data to upsert must match the schema of the collection, otherwise Milvus will raise an exception.  \\nMilvus supports default values for scalar fields, excluding a primary key field. This indicates that some fields can be left empty during data inserts or upserts. For more information, refer to Create a Collection.  \\n```python\\n# Generate data to upsert\\n\\nimport random\\nnb = 3000\\ndim = 8\\nvectors = [[random.random() for _ in range(dim)] for _ in range(nb)]\\ndata = [\\n[i for i in range(nb)],\\n[str(i) for i in range(nb)],\\n[i for i in range(10000, 10000+nb)],\\nvectors,\\n[str(\"dy\"*i) for i in range(nb)]\\n]\\n```', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6409814953804016), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='449755997496672550', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='# Upsert Entities\\n## Upsert data\\nUpsert the data to the collection.  \\n```python\\nfrom pymilvus import Collection\\ncollection = Collection(\"book\") # Get an existing collection.\\nmr = collection.upsert(data)\\n```  \\nParameter\\tDescription\\ndata\\tData to upsert into Milvus.\\npartition_name (optional)\\tName of the partition to upsert data into.\\ntimeout (optional)\\tAn optional duration of time in seconds to allow for the RPC. If it is set to None, the client keeps waiting until the server responds or error occurs.\\nAfter upserting entities into a collection that has previously been indexed, you do not need to re-index the collection, as Milvus will automatically create an index for the newly upserted data. For more information, refer to Can indexes be created after inserting vectors?\\\\\\n\\\\\\n# Upsert Entities\\n## Flush data\\nWhen data is upserted into Milvus it is updated and inserted into segments. Segments have to reach a certain size to be sealed and indexed. Unsealed segments will be searched brute force. In order to avoid this with any remainder data, it is best to call flush(). The flush() call will seal any remaining segments and send them for indexing. It is important to only call this method at the end of an upsert session. Calling it too often will cause fragmented data that will need to be cleaned later on.\\\\\\n\\\\\\n# Upsert Entities\\n## Limits\\nUpdating primary key fields is not supported by upsert().\\nupsert() is not applicable and an error can occur if autoID is set to True for primary key fields.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.5456743240356445)]\n"
