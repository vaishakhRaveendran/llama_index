The key idea behind SecGPT is to isolate the execution of apps and to allow interaction between apps and the system only through well-defined interfaces with user permission. SecGPT can defend against multiple types of attacks, including app compromise, data stealing, inadvertent data exposure, and uncontrolled system alteration.
